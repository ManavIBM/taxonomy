      **Solution Review Board (SRB) Document**

      The SRB document is a formal, detailed proposal required before deploying new services or features to production. It ensures alignment across engineering, offering management, security, compliance, and operations.

      **Overview**
      The SRB Program aims to:
      1. Provide end-to-end architectural clarity for new projects.
      2. Assess risk, compliance, dependencies, and supportability.
      3. Establish standard documentation to streamline onboarding and future reviews.
    question: What is the purpose of an SRB document?
    answer: >
          The SRB document ensures that any new service or offering proposed for production meets IBM's engineering, security, and operational standards. It enables cross-functional review, risk assessment, and alignment across stakeholders.

    question: Can an SRB be generated from a COM ticket?
    answer: >
          Yes. With minimal input such as GPU type, region, and intended purpose captured in a COM or HAHA ticket, a draft SRB can be generated using a predefined template. The remaining sections can be inferred using assumptions, default constraints, and past SRB patterns.
